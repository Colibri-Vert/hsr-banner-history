# Honkai: Star Rail Banner History

## Overview

A visualizer for the banner history in the video game Honkai: Star Rail. This is heavily inspired by the character release timeline for Genshin Impact found on [paimon.moe](https://paimon.moe/banners), however no similar website appears to exist for HSR at the moment.

This is a static site with no backend. It has been hosted on GitHub Pages at [https://colibri-vert.github.io/hsr-banner-history](https://colibri-vert.github.io/hsr-banner-history). The webpage currently displays all limited banner history of 5 star and 4 star characters and light cones, and allows them to be sorted based on either the character/light cone's release date or last rerun.

## Setup

Node.js is required to run the program.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
